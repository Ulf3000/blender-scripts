various scripts for blender

# sort_npanel.py 
Helper script to trigger update on the simple tabs addon  https://chippwalters.gumroad.com/l/simpletabs everytime the workspace/mode/active object is changed. 
Put this in your blender scripts startup folder. 
For best measure you should add a script folder to blender preferences. That way you dont have to do this for every new blender version and works across the board.
